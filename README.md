## NRF Introduction
**Nebula Remote Fusion** (**NRF**) is a lightweight application for managing operating systems remotely. NRF provides both a web-based interface and dedicated applications for various devices, giving you full access to your system from anywhere. It combines high security with flexibility, ensuring your system is protected. NRF is also open-source, promoting transparency and community-driven improvements.

Currently, in its early versions, NRF is only available for Windows, with plans for broader platform support in the future.
